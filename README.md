Overview
This repository contains open research code and data to reproduce the results from the Temporaxis battery motif chain analysis published in [Shea, 2025].
Temporaxis provides interpretable, cycle-based early warnings of lithium-ion battery failure by detecting recursive collapse motif chains in capacity data.

This repository demonstrates the open research logic; proprietary scoring kernels and commercial modules are NOT included.
Non-commercial research and educational use only. For commercial use, contact the author.

What’s Included
Temp_Battery_MotifChain_Final.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with step-by-step code for data loading, motif detection, chain search, benchmarking, and visualization.

all_discharge_capacities.csv — Benchmark battery dataset (34 cells, cycle/capacity).

plots/ — Publication-ready images (all-batteries summary and top 5 case studies).

temporaxis_case_studies.csv, temporaxis_batch_results.csv — Summary results tables.

LICENSE — CC BY-NC 4.0 legal text.
